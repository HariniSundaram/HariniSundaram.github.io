I was overwhelmed with that feeling when I blindly entered my highschool robotics club, which prepared for programming competitions, without background or guidance. Suddenly thrown into a club that is independently driven, I began reading free textbooks and watching endless videos to learn programming and understand the difficult problems in front of me. My journey into the computer field was marked by independence—I sought answers to questions I generated on my own, rather than looking for them to be disseminated to me. Though difficult, I improved in competitions, and later as president, I guided newcomers on their journeys, too. I let them ask their own questions, and we worked together to find answers. </p> -->

                                <p>I created RecipeBuddy as part of a 2-week Term Project for my Freshman Fall Fundamentals of Programming Course. Utilizing Python and BeautifulSoup, I crafted this program in an attempt to offer solutions to food waste, and aid short-on-time individuals in the culinary journey. <br> <br>
                                RecipeBuddy serves as an all-in-one cookbook. It web scrapes and displays recipes based on the ingredients consumers have on hand and cuisine preference, sorting the recipes from least to greatest number of extra ingredients needed, time needed to prepare the recipe, or by the rating from its site. Users are also able to favorite recipes they enjoy, and view all of their favorited recipes in one page. Users are able to create their own recipes and view all of such recipes as well. Lastly, RecipeBuddy can generate recipePlans based on cuisine preferences, ingredients, and nutritional goals — a function ideal for those who aim to plan for the week ahead. </p>
