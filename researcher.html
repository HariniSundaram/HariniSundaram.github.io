                                <p>I am working on the Social AI project. Research in the area of "social artificial intelligence" is lacking. We are currently building a densely annotated dataset that describes complex and nuanced social interactions. For example, identifying emotions such as jealousy, distress, regret,etc. Current models are only able to identify extremely basic emotions such as happiness, anger, and sadness, and does not analyze interactions between mutliple people well. I am also responsible for planning the annotation scheme, and will later be creating models and training this dataset to better analyze social interactions.</p>

                                <p>This research project was headed by Dr. Anand Santhanam at the UCLA Department of Radiology/ Oncology. This project involved working on editing datasets of 4D Computer Topography (4DCT) scans of cancerous lung tissue leading to the design of a neural network that can track lung cancer growth. The goal of this research project is to quantify cancer growth and detect efficacy of current cancer treatment paths.

                                <p>My first research experience was under Dr. Alexander Brummer and Dr. Van Savage at the UCLA Department of Biomathematics. At my internship there, I worked with a program that reconstructed blood vessels in the brain by authoring a piece of code that would determine the optimal speed and efficacy of a reconstruction program. I also analyzed these datasets in an attempt to determine correlations between the locations of the blood vessels, the curvature and torsion of the blood vessels and other properties of the blood vessels. The project is a first step to eventually identifying diseased vessels, including those linked to strokes and tumors, at an early stage prior to serious consequences. </p>
