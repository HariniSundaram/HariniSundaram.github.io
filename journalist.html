                                <p>Through my experience on El Vaquero, my high school newspaper, and now The Tartan, I discovered a love for verbal engagement—and not just basic introductions or chatter, but deep conversations and debates. I talk about anything and everything, from mundane algebra homework to debates over campaign finance. I used to interview ad clients, negotiating advertisement prices and resolving issues. I converse with my fellow peers, my teachers, and even professionals off of my school campus. I revel in approaching a stranger and striking up a conversation. My skills go far beyond the newspaper room. Rather, these skills work concurrently and actually aid me with my STEM passion.

                                        <p>When Carnegie Mellon announced their decision to remove spring break, I immediately hated it. Why would the administration choose to rip away the one thing students and faculty all look forward to? Alas, my first chance to experience a college spring break was taken from me. The thought of enduring a full semester of Carnegie Mellon curriculum and stress without a major break still seems inconceivable. However, after closer examination of the circumstances that forced the hand of the administration shines some light to the decision. The fact of the matter is that under the extenuating circumstances we are all under, the current state of the calendar is the only viable option left, after prioritizing our health and the interests of all students and faculty...</p>

                    <p>We have all done that stare of shame. After just exiting the freeway, a homeless man in tattered 
                        clothes with a plea for help written on a cardboard sign catches your eye. Does he deserve our hard-earned money? 
                        Is he pretending to be homeless?  Worst of all, what if he is in genuine need, but you misjudged and didn’t help?<br><br>

                        California Gov. Newsom made homelessness the focus of his State of the State Address this month, reflecting Californians' 
                        top concern of this issue. As of January 2019, there were 6,680 homeless people living in Orange County, a 70% increase 
                        in the homeless population from 2018, according to the Point in Time Count census. With this growing crisis, Irvine residents 
                        can no longer ignore this problem and should do their part in assisting others. <br><br>
                        
                        Today, homelessness is a common occurrence. The same 2019 census showed 16 cities in Orange County each had more than 
                        100 homeless people—with Santa Ana having 1,769 homeless people and 1,202 in Anaheim. Comparatively, Irvine’s reported 
                        130 homeless people doesn’t create a strong visible homeless population. However, this does not excuse Irvine residents 
                        from being part of the solution. The rapid growth of homelessness in neighboring cities serves as a wake-up call; we can’t 
                        follow the “out of sight out of mind” ideology any longer. <br><br>
                        
                        Yet years of being forgotten and ignored has left homeless people with overwhelming barriers to support themselves. According to a 
                        UnitedWay and University of California, Irvine study, 40% of homeless people cite the inability to keep a job with sustainable wages, 
                        36% said they had difficulty finding affordable housing and 17% cited mental health issues as the reason fueling their homelessness. 
                        These factors— low wages, unaffordable housing and mental health— are out of their control. Ignoring people who are unable to support 
                        themselves due to uncontrollable factors is dehumanizing. Considering their circumstances, the least we can do is empathize with their 
                        situation and lend a hand. 
                        <br><br>
                        While Orange County has attempted to ease the crisis by building affordable housing units, action is still painfully slow. 
                        Two years ago, Orange County promised to build 2,700 affordable housing units, yet only a few dozen have been finished. Simultaneously, also in Irvine, 
                        homeless people can be ticketed for sleeping and loitering in public places. In 2018, residents protested against the formation of a homeless encampment 
                        in Irvine, with slogans such as “No-Tent City” and “Not In My Backyard,” pushing homeless people out of Irvine and into neighboring cities. The underlying problem 
                        is not solved by these measures. Instead, Irvine is merely isolated and evidence of poverty is erased. The community cannot wait for the government to slowly target 
                        the homelessness crisis. The time is now: individuals must step out of the “Irvine Bubble” and take some responsibility to assist the community. <br><br>
                        
                        Homelessness is a cycle of hopelessness that threatens our entire community. 
                        The best way to do so is by donating to associations such as Families Forward. 
                        Take part in school clothing and food drives. Volunteer your time at local clubs such as Brown Bag Brigade. 
                        Lend a hand, so the next time you drive down that freeway and see a person in need, you no longer need to feel 
                        shame and instead know exactly how to make their day better. We need to remember our Irvine High value of social responsibility to ease this local problem.</p>
